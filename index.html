<h2>Climbing이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<img src="climbing img.jpg" width="100%"> 
<strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing" target="_blank" title="climbing wikipedia">Climbing</a></strong></u> is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a steep topographical object.
It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition, and within trades that rely on ascension; 
such as emergency rescue and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural and man-made structures.

<h2>Climbing Types</h2>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Bouldering: Ascending boulders or small outcrops, often with climbing shoes and a chalk bag or bucket. Usually, instead of using a safety rope from above, injury is avoided using a crash pad and a human spotter (to direct a falling climber on to the pad. They can also give beta, or advice)[2]<br></p>
<p>Buildering: Ascending the exterior skeletons of buildings, typically without protective equipment.</p>
